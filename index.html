                A logistician is an individual who is responsible for
                the supply chain within a business. Individuals who
                work in this capacity perform a variety of tasks that
                can include purchasing, inventory, delivery,
                transportation and warehousing. They are responsible
                for the entire lifecycle of a product and direct its
                movement during all stages.
